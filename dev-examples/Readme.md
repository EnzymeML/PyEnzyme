# Dev Examples

These examples are intended to be used during development towards 2.0.0 and will be removed in the final release.

## How to run the examples

Dev examples should be run from the root directory of the repository and will produce outputs to the dev-example folder.

```bash
# From the root directory
python ./dev-examples/*.py
```
