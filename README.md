PyEnzyme is the interface to the data model <b>EnzymeML</b> and offers a convenient way to document and model research data. Lightweight syntax for rapid development of data management solution in enzymology and biocatalysis.</p>

### üß¨ Features

- Reproducible **documentation** of enzymatic and biocatalytic experiments.
- **Import** from and **export** to the SBML-based markup language **EnzymeML** and more.
- Perform **database-specific validation** prior to database upload.
- Model your data using a **Thin Layer**  to popular modeling platforms.
- **Visualize** experimental results for inspection and publication.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Get started with PyEnzyme by running the following command

```
# Using PyPI
python -m pip install pyenzyme
```

Or build by source

```
git clone https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme.git
cd PyEnzyme

```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Package Options

PyEnzyme comes with many flavors, choose whether you want only the base installation, the modeling package or all of it
using the following options.

```
# COPASI - modeling
python -m pip install "pyenzyme[copasi]"

# PySCeS - modeling
python -m pip install "pyenzyme[pysces]"

# Modeling package
python -m pip install "pyenzyme[modeling]"

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example code

This example will demonstrate how to create a simple EnzymeML document using PyEnzyme and how to use initializers from
official databases **Chebi** and **UniProt** to gather metadata. For more examples, please visit
our [documentation](https://pyenzyme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) (Work in progress)

```python
# To be added for V2
```

<sub>(Code should run as it is)</sup>
