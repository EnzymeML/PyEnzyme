## What is PyEnzyme?

PyEnzyme is the Python interface to the **EnzymeML** data model, offering a convenient way to document and model research data. With its lightweight syntax, PyEnzyme enables rapid development of data management solutions in enzymology and biocatalysis.

PyEnzyme provides reproducible **documentation** of enzymatic and biocatalytic experiments, allowing you to **import** from and **export** to the **EnzymeML** format and more. You can **fetch** entities from official databases like [CheBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/), [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/), [PubChem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/), [RHEA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/rhea/), and [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/), and **visualize** experimental results for inspection and publication.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example showing what PyEnzyme can do. This snippet demonstrates creating an EnzymeML document, fetching data from databases, and working with measurements:

```python
import pyenzyme as pe

# Create a simple EnzymeML document
enzmldoc = pe.EnzymeMLDocument(name="My Experiment")

# Add a vessel (reaction container)
vessel = enzmldoc.add_to_vessels(
    id="vessel_1",
    name="Vessel 1",
    volume=1.0,
    unit="l",  # Units are automatically converted
)

# Fetch a protein from UniProt
protein = pe.fetch_uniprot("P07327", vessel_id=vessel.id)
enzmldoc.proteins.append(protein)

# Fetch a reaction from RHEA database
reaction, participants = pe.fetch_rhea("RHEA:22864", vessel_id=vessel.id)
enzmldoc.small_molecules += participants
enzmldoc.reactions.append(reaction)

# Parse experimental data from a file
measurements = pe.from_excel(
    path="measurements.xlsx",
    data_unit="mmol / l",
    time_unit="h",
)
enzmldoc.measurements += measurements

# Save to EnzymeML format
pe.write_enzymeml(enzmldoc, "enzmldoc.json")

# Load from EnzymeML format
enzmldoc = pe.read_enzymeml("enzmldoc.json")
```

This example shows how PyEnzyme simplifies working with enzymatic data by automatically handling unit conversions, fetching metadata from databases, and providing a clean interface for creating structured experimental documentation.
