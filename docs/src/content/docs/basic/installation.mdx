description: Install PyEnzyme and get ready to start using it.
---

## Prerequisites

PyEnzyme requires Python 3.10 or higher. You can install PyEnzyme using either `pip` (the standard Python package manager) or `uv` (a faster, modern alternative).

## Install with pip

The standard way to install PyEnzyme is using pip:

```bash
pip install pyenzyme
```

This installs PyEnzyme with all core dependencies, including support for reading and writing EnzymeML documents, database fetchers, visualization tools, and unit handling.

## Install with uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package manager written in Rust. It's significantly faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution. If you don't have uv installed, you can install it first:

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install PyEnzyme:

```bash
uv pip install pyenzyme
```

## Install from source

To install the latest development version or contribute to PyEnzyme, clone the repository and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme.git
cd PyEnzyme
pip install -e .
```

Installing in editable mode (`-e`) allows you to make changes to the source code that will be immediately reflected without reinstalling.

## Optional dependencies

PyEnzyme provides optional dependency groups for extended functionality. The available groups are:

### Excel support (`excel`)

Enables reading and writing Excel files (`.xlsx`). Installs `openpyxl`.

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[excel]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[excel]"
```

### PySCeS integration (`pysces`)

Enables kinetic modeling and parameter fitting using PySCeS. Installs `pysces` and `lmfit`.

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[pysces]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[pysces]"
```

See the [mathematical modeling guide](/basic/modelling/) for details on using PySCeS with PyEnzyme.

### COPASI support (`copasi`)

Enables using COPASI for kinetic modeling and parameter fitting. Installs `copasi-basico`.

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[copasi]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[copasi]"
```

See the [COPASI integration guide](/integrations/copasi/) for details on using COPASI with PyEnzyme.

### Development dependencies (`tests`)

Includes testing tools for development and running the test suite. Installs `pytest`, `pytest-httpx`, and `pytest-sugar`.

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[tests]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[tests]"
```

### Legacy API support (`v1`)

Provides backward compatibility with PyEnzyme v1.x. Installs `seaborn`, `numexpr`, `python-libcombine`, `deepdiff`, and `deprecation`.

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[v1]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[v1]"
```

The legacy API is available via `pyenzyme.v1`. New projects should use the current API.

### Installing multiple extras

You can install multiple optional dependencies at once:

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install "pyenzyme[excel,pysces]"
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install "pyenzyme[excel,pysces]"
```

### Using uv dependency groups

When using uv, you can also leverage dependency groups directly when installing from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme.git
cd PyEnzyme
uv pip install -e ".[pysces,excel,tests,v1]"
```

## Verify installation

After installation, verify that PyEnzyme is working correctly:

```python
import pyenzyme as pe
print(pe.__version__)
```

If you see the version number printed, PyEnzyme is installed successfully.

## Next steps

Once PyEnzyme is installed, proceed to the next guide to learn how to create EnzymeML documents.
