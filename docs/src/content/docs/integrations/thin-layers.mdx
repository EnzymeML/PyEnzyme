## What Are Thin Layers?

Thin layers are PyEnzyme's interface for connecting experimental data to powerful kinetic modeling tools. They function as **translators** that bridge EnzymeML (the experimental data format) and the language of modeling software.

For experimentalists who have collected time-course data showing how concentrations change over time, thin layers enable:

1. **Simulation** of model predictions under different conditions
2. **Parameter fitting** of models to experimental data to determine kinetic parameters  
3. **Comparison** of model predictions with experimental measurements

PyEnzyme handles all translation automatically. Manual data conversion or learning complex modeling software interfaces is not required.

## The Workflow

The typical workflow is straightforward:

1. **Prepare an EnzymeML document** with reactions, equations, and measurements
2. **Choose a thin layer** (PySCeS or COPASI) based on requirements
3. **Simulate** to observe model predictions
4. **Optimize** to fit parameters to experimental data
5. **Export** the fitted parameters back to the EnzymeML document

## Available Thin Layers

PyEnzyme provides thin layers for two popular modeling tools. Both provide the same interface, enabling easy switching between them:
