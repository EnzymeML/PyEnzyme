The Zen of EnzymeML

Data should be clear, not obscure.
Standards bring order, where chaos lures.

Metadata matters, more than you think.
Incomplete experiments push us to the brink.

Simplicity over manual toil.
Automation keeps the data loyal.

Fair data finds its way with ease,
Accessible formats put minds at peace.

Interoperable tools, well-defined,
Reusability should be the design.

Subtle is the flow from lab to code,
Experimental truth is always the node.

Errors are costly, so let’s be precise,
In structured fields, all data plays nice.

Manual steps breed disorder and strife,
Automate where you can, that’s the key to life.

When data is structured, and models align,
Kinetics and reactions will always shine.

EnzymeML is not a rule to fear,
But a guide that keeps your path clear.

Embrace the flow, adopt the way,
For seamless data, is here to stay.
